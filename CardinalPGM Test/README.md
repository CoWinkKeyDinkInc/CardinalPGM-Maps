CardinalPGM Test
================

This map was created by CoWinkKeyDinkInc for testing out CardinalPGM and other PGM clones.
This map is designed to test for many of the basic elements that are common on modern OCN maps today.

This map currently tests the following:

### Gamemodes
 - DTC
 - DTM
 - CTW
 - Blitz

### Core game features
 - Core modes
 - Monument modes
 - Goal posts
 - Extra points when carrying special object into a goal post
 - Control points
 - Villagers (used in Gear maps)
 - Wool spawners

### Other game features
 - Item regeneration
 - Mob spawners

## Creating spawners
Creating custom item and mob spawners is really easy!!  Use this site [here](https://mcstacker.bimbimma.com/)
to go and make custom mobs in-game!!  Some cases may require a command block to use.

**Note:** To make wool and other items spawn properly, it is suggested that `SpawnRange`, `RequiredPlayerRange`
and `MaxNearbyEntities` are all set with a defined number.  `RequiredPlayerRange` only works if `MaxNearbyEntities` is set.
