# CardinalPGM-Maps
The sequel to OCN-Maps, but like all sequels it's not as good.

A ton of maps are submitted on the OCN forums as public downloads. Unfortunately, lots of these maps don't get any further than the fourms, including many good ones that could play great.

What this repository does is try to update and fix the maps so they can play better, along with trying to make them more compatible with [CardinalPGM](https://github.com/twizmwazin/CardinalPGM), an amazing open source plugin that allows you to play maps just like if it was on OCN!

## How do I contribute?
 - If you have a map that you want to be updated or fixed, submit a pull request!
 - Please only have one map per pull request.
 - Please only submit pull requests adding new maps if you're the author of the map or have permission to do so.
 - Use proper spacing and formatting in XML, spacing will make XML files much easier to read.
 
## Saving space
 - Please [prune](https://docs.oc.tc/packaging/pruning_chunks) chunks, remove unnecessary entities and delete `.mcr`  files before submitting maps. GitHub repositories are limited to 1GB in size and I'd only want to make a second one if it's absolutely necessary.
 - Deleting unnecessary files can make a massive difference. This reduction was done by just deleting 64 `.mcr` files and removing all entities.
