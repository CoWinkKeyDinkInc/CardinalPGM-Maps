# CardinalPGM-Maps
The sequel to OCN-Maps, but like all sequels it's not as good.

A ton of maps are submitted on the OCN forums as public downloads. Unfortunately, lots of these maps don't get any further than the forums, including many good ones that could play great.

What this repository does is try to update and fix the maps so they can play better, look better, and are proven to work. We'll also try to make them more compatible with [CardinalPGM](https://github.com/twizmwazin/CardinalPGM), an amazing open source plugin that allows you to play maps just like if it was on OCN!

## How do I contribute?
 - If you have a map that you want to be updated or fixed, submit a pull request!
 - If the pull request is a fix in a map, please only have one map involved in a commit and include pictures on aesthetic changes.
 - Use proper spacing and formatting in XML, spacing will make XML files much easier to read.

## How do I get my map on this repository?
 - The only requirement for maps to be considered adding to the repo is that there will be no conflicts arising from the map being added. You must be the author of a map, or have permission to do so to submit a pull request containing the map.
 - Submit a pull request with the map and XML.  If approved, it will be merged, which then we can make fixes and improvements on the map through other pull requests.

## Saving space
 - Please [prune](https://docs.oc.tc/packaging/pruning_chunks) chunks, remove unnecessary entities and delete `.mcr`  files before submitting maps. GitHub repositories are limited to 1GB in size and I'd only want to make a second one if it's absolutely necessary.
 - Deleting unnecessary files can make a massive difference. This reduction was done by just deleting 64 `.mcr` files and removing all entities.
